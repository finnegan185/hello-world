Beginning of my  journey to tech

Hi Humans!

Zack here, as stated above I am making the transition to the tech world and industry. I have always been fascinated by tech and advancement and I have finally decided to pursue that interest.
My plan is to document my progress and projects on github for myself to view the progress and to provide evidence to future employers that I can actually do the things I say I can.
My hope is that this will be an enjoyable and lifelong journey. 

Zack
